The MAGICS++ Web Documentation
------------------------------

General
-------

The web pages are all generated by Perl scripts. Most of the content
is within the scripts, but some of the more common pieces of text
are contained in files in the 'common' directory.

Each 'chapter' is contained in a numbered dircetory, eg 2_interfaces.

The scripts in 3_parameters read in an XML file that contains information
about all of the action routines, objects and parameters and use this
to generate their web pages. This XML file is automatically generated
from the XML files in libMagPlus/src/xml.


Setup
-----

In order to create all the required directories, run the script
  tools/make_html_dirs
from the current directory.


Generating HTML and uploading to the web server
-----------------------------------------------

To generate the HTML from the Perl scripts, run 'tohtml'.
The output files will be in the 'html' directory.

To upload these files to the w3ec2 server, run 'upload'.
You will be required to enter your username and password; do this,
then click the 'OK' button to proceed with the upload.

(Some auxillary scripts used by 'tohtml' and 'upload' are contained
in the 'tools' directory).
