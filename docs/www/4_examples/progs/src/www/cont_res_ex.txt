Magics++ supports different resolutions in its Akima contouring algorithms; the lower
the resolution, the coarser the results but the faster the execution. Low resolutions
are acceptable for global plots, but finer resolutions are required when examining
smaller areas.

Since MAGICS 6.9 does not support the adjustment of resolution in its contouring
algorithm, there is only one page to the 6.9 plot for comparison with Magics++.
