MAGICS 6.9 is using CONICON, Magics++ is using AKIMA760
with a resolution of 0.1.
<P>
Note that by default MAGICS 6.9 has parameter GRIB_SUBAREA_EXTRACTION set
to ON, meaning that the second page appears incomplete. This parameter has
not yet been implemented in Magics++, hence both pages contain all
available data.
