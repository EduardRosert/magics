      PROGRAM TRANSPARENT

C     This program demonstrates magics contouring facilities. 
C     The meteorological data field is a standard global 500 hpa
C     model output field on a regular 1.5 degree grid. 
C     Contours and coastlines are projected onto a map.


C     Open MAGICS and set the output device

      CALL POPEN
      CALL PARSE_COMMAND_LINE ('transparent')
      CALL PSETC ('GD_TRANSPARENT', 'ON')


C     Set up the coastline attributes

      CALL PSETC ('MAP_COASTLINE_COLOUR', 'GREY')
      CALL PSETC ('MAP_GRID_COLOUR',      'GREY')     


C     Pass the data to MAGICS

      CALL PSETC ('GRIB_INPUT_TYPE',      'FILE')
      CALL PSETC ('GRIB_INPUT_FILE_NAME', 'data/z500.grb')
      CALL PSETC ('GRIB_SPECIFICATION',   'OFF')
      CALL PGRIB
      

C     Define the contour     

      CALL PSETC  ('CONTOUR_LINE_COLOUR',      'BLUE')
      CALL PSETC  ('CONTOUR_HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR', 'BLUE')
      CALL PCONT


C     Set up and plot the title text

      CALL PSETI ('TEXT_REDUCTION_LEVEL', 2)
      CALL PTEXT


C     Plot the coastlines and then close

      CALL PCOAST
      CALL PCLOSE

      STOP
      END
