Example usage:

./togallery.sh 

This script generates the whole gallery files and upload them to Magics Wiki (Confluence).

Preconditions:

A few scripts (example2jira.py, prettyPython.py, pythonTidy) in the main directory(.../magics/docs/confluence) have to be accessible as Python packages
from its subdirectories. To do so, PYTHONPATH environment variable should be updated to include .../magics/docs/confluence

Constructing new examples:

When adding a new example to any of the already defined sets (axis, coastlines, etc.), next steps should be followed:
1. Add the new example script and any other data file into the corresponding directory (e.g. copy "wind5.py" into "confluence/wind").
2. Update "tojira.py" script of the corresponding directory (e.g. "confluence/wind/tojira.py").

When adding a new set of examples (axis, coastlines, etc), additional steps should be followed:
1. Create the corresponding directory for the set of examples (e.g. "confluence/epsgram").
2. Add the new examples files into the directory.
3. Create a "tojira.py" script for the set (e.g. "confluence/epsgram/tojira.py").
4. Update "confluence/togallery.sh", "confluence/tojira.py" scripts with new set details.
5. Previous scripts assume that a page for the set of examples (e.g. "EPSgram examples") exists in confluence.
   It is advised to create the new page using other as template (e.g. "Axis examples").
6. Update "confluence/gallery/generateMagicsGallery.py" script, including the new page details: page id and title.
