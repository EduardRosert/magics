Example usage:

./versioncmp.sh new++   old++  ./examples/fred/dorun.sh -output ./output_fred
./versioncmp.sh 2.13.7  2.12.5  ./examples/cyclone/dorun.sh -output ./output_cyclone
./versioncmp.sh new++   2.13.4 ./examples/shading/dorun.sh -output ./output_shading

Additional options: -v       Verbose output while running
                    -force   Force overwrite of existing output files
                    -output  Sets the output folder (defaults to ./output)

Once the script has run, use a web browser to open the file comp.html within the output folder.

Constructing new examples:

New examples should contain only the command that produces a plot. No instruction, hard-coded path or any other manner of forcing the use of a particular version of Magics should be used or false results will occur. The script that produces the comparison plot varies the paths according to user input.

However, versions of other tools or libraries used in plot production MAY be hardcoded, for example the version of grib_api or a particular compiler etc.
